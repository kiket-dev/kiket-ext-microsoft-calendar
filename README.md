# Microsoft Calendar Extension

Sync Outlook Calendar events to Kiket's team capacity planning. Automatically imports events from Microsoft 365 and updates team member availability.

## Features

- **Automatic Sync**: Periodically imports calendar events to capacity planning

- **Health Monitoring**: Alerts when sync issues occur

## Requirements

- Kiket Platform v1.0+
- [Microsoft OAuth Extension](https://github.com/kiket-dev/kiket-ext-microsoft-oauth) (installed automatically as dependency)
- Microsoft 365 or Outlook.com account

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Kiket Marketplace or via CLI:
   ```bash
   kiket extensions install microsoft-calendar
   ```

2. The Microsoft OAuth extension will be installed automatically if not present

3. Connect your Microsoft account when prompted

## Setup

### 1. Connect Microsoft Account

If you haven't already connected your Microsoft account:

1. Go to **Settings > Connected Accounts**
2. Click **Connect** next to Microsoft
3. Authorize calendar access in the popup

### 2. Select Calendars to Sync

1. Go to **Capacity > External Calendars**
2. Click **Add Calendar > Microsoft Calendar**
3. Select which calendars to sync
4. Configure sync settings

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `default_sync_interval` | 60 min | How often to sync calendar events |
| `sync_window_days` | 180 days | How far ahead to sync events |
| `include_private_events` | false | Sync private events (title only) |
| `include_tentative` | true | Include tentatively accepted events |

### Event Type Mapping

Events are automatically categorized based on keywords in the title or Outlook categories:

| Event Type | Keywords |
|------------|----------|
| Holiday | "holiday", "bank holiday" |
| PTO | "vacation", "pto", "out of office", "ooo", "time off" |
| Travel | "travel", "flight", "trip" |
| Focus | "focus", "deep work", "heads down", "focus time" |
| Training | "training", "learning", "workshop" |

You can customize the mapping in extension settings.

## Usage

### Automatic Sync

Once configured, the extension automatically syncs on the configured interval. Events appear in:
- **Capacity Calendar**: Visual calendar view
- **User Availability**: Affects capacity calculations
- **AI Recommendations**: Considered in load balancing

### Manual Sync

Trigger a manual sync via:
- **Command Palette**: Search for "Sync Outlook Calendar"
- **Capacity UI**: Click the refresh button on your calendar feed

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `microsoftCalendar.sync` | Manually trigger calendar sync |
| `microsoftCalendar.listCalendars` | View available Outlook Calendars |

## Required Scopes

This extension requires the following Microsoft Graph scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Calendars.Read` | List calendars and read events |

These scopes are automatically requested when you connect your Microsoft account.

## Capacity Integration

Synced events affect capacity planning:

- **Blocking Events**: Reduce available hours (show as "Busy")
- **All-Day Events**: Mark entire day as unavailable
- **Tentative Events**: Optionally reduce capacity
- **Recurring Events**: Each occurrence synced separately
- **Free/Busy Status**: Respects Outlook's availability settings

## Outlook-Specific Features

### Show As Status

The extension respects Outlook's "Show As" status:
- **Busy**: Blocks capacity
- **Out of Office**: Blocks capacity, maps to PTO
- **Tentative**: Optionally blocks (configurable)
- **Free**: Does not block capacity
- **Working Elsewhere**: Does not block capacity

### Categories

Outlook categories can be mapped to Kiket event types for automatic classification.

## Troubleshooting

### Events not syncing
1. Check connection status in **Settings > Connected Accounts**
2. Verify the calendar is selected in **Capacity > External Calendars**
3. Check feed health status for errors

### "Insufficient privileges" error
- Ensure `Calendars.Read` permission is granted
- Ask your admin to consent if using organizational account

### Wrong timezone
1. Verify your Kiket timezone in **Settings > Preferences**
2. Check calendar timezone in Outlook settings

### Missing events
- Check if the event is within the sync window (default: 180 days)
- Private events require `include_private_events` enabled

### "Calendar feed unhealthy" warning
- The extension monitors sync health
- Alerts are sent after 12+ hours of failures
- Check Microsoft account connection and re-authorize if needed

## Health Monitoring

The extension includes health monitoring:
- Tracks consecutive sync failures
- Status: Healthy → Degraded (3 failures) → Unhealthy (12+ hours)
- Sends notifications when feeds become unhealthy

## Security

- Calendar data is read-only (no write access requested)
- Events are stored encrypted in Kiket's database
- OAuth tokens managed by Microsoft OAuth extension
- Private event details excluded by default (only title synced if enabled)
- Works with Azure AD conditional access policies
